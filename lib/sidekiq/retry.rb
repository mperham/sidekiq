  # Sidekiq's retry support assumes a typical development lifecycle:
  # 0. push some code changes with a bug in it
  # 1. bug causes message processing to fail, sidekiq's middleware captures
  #    the message and pushes it onto a retry queue
  # 2. sidekiq retries messages in the retry queue multiple times with
  #    an exponential delay, the message continues to fail
  # 3. after a few days, a developer deploys a fix.  the message is
  #    reprocessed successfully.
  # 4. if 3 never happens, sidekiq will eventually give up and throw the
  #    message away.
