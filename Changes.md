HEAD
-----------

- Fix fetch breaking retry when used with Redis namespaces. [#109]
- Redis connection now just a plain ConnectionPool, not CP::Wrapper.
- Capistrano initial deploy fix [#106]
- Re-implemented weighted queues support (ryanlecompte)

0.11.0
-----------

- Client-side API changes, added sidekiq\_options for Sidekiq::Worker.
  As a side effect of this change, the client API works on Ruby 1.8.
  It's not officially supported but should work [#103]
- NO POLL!  Sidekiq no longer polls Redis, leading to lower network
  utilization and lower latency for message processing.  As a side
  effect of this change, queue weights are no longer supported. If you
  wish to process multiple queues, list them in the order you want
  them processed: `sidekiq -q critical -q high -q default -q low`
- Add --version CLI option

0.10.1
-----------

- Add details page for jobs in retry queue (jcoene)
- Display relative timestamps in web interface (jcoene)
- Capistrano fixes (hinrik, bensie)

0.10.0
-----------

- Reworked capistrano recipe to make it more fault-tolerant [#94].
- Automatic failure retry!  Sidekiq will now save failed messages
  and retry them, with an exponential backoff, over about 20 days.
  Did a message fail to process?  Just deploy a bug fix in the next
  few days and Sidekiq will retry the message eventually.

0.9.1
-----------

- Fix missed deprecations, poor method name in web UI

0.9.0
-----------

- Add -t option to configure the TERM shutdown timeout
- TERM shutdown timeout is now configurable, defaults to 5 seconds.
- USR1 signal now stops Sidekiq from accepting new work,
  capistrano sends USR1 at start of deploy and TERM at end of deploy
  giving workers the maximum amount of time to finish.
